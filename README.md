# Integrating CKeditor with Django and React
## Introduction

This project demonstrates how to seamlessly incorporate the powerful CKeditor rich text editor into a web application built with Django on the backend and React on the frontend. CKeditor offers a versatile and user-friendly text editing experience, making it a popular choice for applications that require rich content creation.

Let's dive in.

## Installation  

To set up the project, you'll need to install the following dependencies:  

- **Django:**  
  `pip install django`  
  Django is a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable websites. It follows the model-template-views (MTV) architectural pattern and includes various built-in features for handling user authentication, database management, and web routing.  

- **django-ckeditor:**  
  `pip install django-ckeditor`  
  This is a Django application that integrates the CKEditor rich text editor into your Django project, allowing for enhanced text editing capabilities. In this project, we will utilize this package to provide a user-friendly interface for content creation, leveraging its wide array of formatting tools and features.  

- **django-cors-headers:**  
  `pip install django-cors-headers`  
  This package is used to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in Django applications. It enables your Django backend to accept requests from different origins, which is essential when your frontend (built with React) and backend (Django) are hosted on different domains or ports during development.

- **@ckeditor:**
<br>
`npm install @ckeditor/ckeditor5-react`
<br>
`npm install @ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-classic`
<br>
This package provides the classic editor build and React integration for CKEditor 5, a powerful rich text editor. It allows developers to incorporate a feature-rich text editing experience in their applications. The @ckeditor/ckeditor5-react package enables seamless integration with React, providing essential lifecycle methods and hooks to manage the editor component effectively. The classic build includes a set of essential features, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, including content management systems, blogs, and any application that requires rich text editing capabilities.

- **axios:**
<br>
`npm install axios`
<br>
Axios is a promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js, widely used for making HTTP requests. It simplifies the process of sending requests to APIs and managing responses. With Axios, you can easily send GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests while handling request and response interceptors, configuration, and error handling. This makes it an ideal choice for working with RESTful APIs, such as when your frontend (React) needs to communicate with your backend (Django). Its built-in support for JSON data transformation and easy cancellation of requests further enhances its usability in modern web applications.
